Both of them will be looked into," he said while addressing an event organised by Laghu Udyog Bharti here.Assuring relief to the MSME sector, Meghwal said the next budget will look into their concerns.Spelling out advantages of demonetisation, Meghwal said that it will help lower interest rate.Besides, it is choking the funding to terrorist organisation and flushing out black money from the system.Naxal activities have come down significantly across the country, he added.On the issue of major amount of old Rs 500/1000 currency have come back into the system, he said, it can be said with clarity only after reconciling data.Banks are yet to segregate fake currencies from the deposits that they have got and there are issues of double counting of deposits of banks and post offices.These issues would be cleared after reconciliation takes place, he added.With regard to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Meghwal said the government intends to implement it from April 1."The Constitution does not permit delay in GST implementation.  .......

He urged upon the people to support the campaign of the government for the less cash society.Speaking at the 100th mega draw of lots for Lucky Grahak Yojna and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojna at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President stressed that efforts of the government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them proactively.  .......  Even countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place, said Mukherjee, while complimenting the government for promotion of digital transactions.After the November 8 announcement of the decision on demonetization, the NITI Aayog had launched two schemes - Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana for the merchants.The President picked up six lucky winners on the final day of the 100 day scheme.

A thumbprint and an Aadhar card are all that are needed for a merchant to receive customer's payment.  .......  He said looks forward to the day when people walk around with absolutely no money in their pockets."I see five policemen guarding one ATM and I'm astonished. If we dealt without so much cash, your mobile phone will become your ATM. A day isn't far away when banks have no premises or paper," PM Modi said.

1)  Govt to integrate BHIM app with Aadhaar for transactions. 
 NEW DELHI: Your Aadhaar card could soon become a universal payment ID. In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI).  .......  The results are very encouraging," Pandey had told ET earlier.The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

2)  UID not delivered? Take a print of your e-Aadhaar. 
 BANGALORE: If you are one of those waiting for your Aadhaar card, log on to the UIDAI website, key in your enrolment number and take a print of your e-Aadhaar card. This, according to UID deputy director general Ashok Dalwai, is as valid as having a card.With lakhs of Aadhaar applicants waiting for months, and in some cases years, to get their Unique Identity card, the UID chief in Karnataka says the public need not panic if the card is not despatched.What's e-Aadhaar?e-Aadhaar is the digital copy of the Aadhaar card available online for genuine applicants, whose enrolment has no glitches.  .......  Over 10 lakh to 1 crore cards have been held back," said Ashok Dalwai.PAY FOR CHANGE OF ADDRESS?As of now, self-updation, like change of address, is free of cost, but there are chances of a nominal fee being charged for the service. "The fee structure depends on the registrars who've tied up with the UID. A nominal fee would be collected for such service soon," he said.

We would work on stabilising and consolidating this capability in the coming days. We have been able to achieve this speed and scale due to our multiple registrar model, as well as scalable technical architecture," UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani said.At present, there are around 20,000 enrollment stations across the country being run by about 50 registrars for registration of citizens under the scheme.The UIDAI has generated 59.6 million crore Aadhaar numbers in a short span of a little more than a year and more than 100 million citizens have enrolled themselves in the system across the country, the statement said.

2)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

2)  'Cabinet may look into NPR, UID work duplication'. 
 NEW DELHI: Planning Commission will urge the Cabinet to resolve the issue of duplication of work between Nandan Nilekani-led Unique Identification Authority and National Population Register of the Census Office.NPR has the mandate to provide biometric-based identity cards while the UID authority was asked to provide unique identity numbers to all residents.Earlier, the understanding was that NPR would share its data with UID authority and vice-versa but later, Registrar General of India (RGI) refused to use the UIDAI's data."We are going to discuss the issue in Cabinet," deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia said, adding that UID project was crucial to extend benefits of welfare schemes to common man and the government was keen to roll it out quickly.He also tried to put to rest the controversy over differences between the plan panel and UIDAI over financial and executive autonomy the latter."UIDAI is getting our full support. We have resolved all issues related to financial and executive authority of the body and it has been approved by the finance ministry," Ahluwalia said.The controversy had erupted after plan panel member-secretary Sudha Pillai reportedly expressed reservations over UIDAI's functioning.  .......  Nilekani later clarified that UIDAI was working under a set government framework and on the basis of powers delegated to it by the prime minister. Nilekani also said giving IDs to people was a government project and it was open to scrutiny by Parliament, CAG, CVC or CBI.However, Ahluwalia said, "UIDAI has to get periodic approval (from government)."The UID authority is tasked with generating Aadhaar unique identity cards and so far it has enrolled 10 crore citizens under the scheme and issued unique identity numbers to five crore people.Under the first phase of the project, the authority is to enroll 20 crore citizens by March 2012. The project aims to provide about 60 crore unique identification numbers by 2014.The UPA government's ambitious project, which was launched in September 2010, aims to improve implementation of welfare schemes.Nilekani said Aadhaar identity cards were accepted as valid documents under the Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts, securing mobile connections and getting cooking gas connections.

3)  UIDAI registration for all Aadhaar authentication devices soon. 
 NEW DELHI: UIDAI is expected to make it compulsory, in the next 4-5 months, for all biometric devices using Aadhaar authentication to embed Aadhaar encryption key into the device at the time of manufacturing.Today, all such devices are STQC certified but registration by way of embedding the encryption key of UIDAI will add another security layer to the hardware at a time when such devices are all set to take the centre stage in biometric-based digital payments."We are going to say that in India only registered devices will work (for Aadhaar authentication). If you want to use Aadhaar authentication, then your devices will have to be registered with us," Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI told PTI.Pandey said that the registration with UIDAI implied that the device will be embedded with Aadhaar encryption key of UIDAI at manufacturing stage itself.  .......  We are now going one step further, we are going to put our encryption key in every device. All devices will have to be registered by us, it will further add to the security," he said.Asked about the timeframe in which UIDAI will mandate the same, Pandey said, "in the next 4-5 months." He said the same would hold true for smartphones or any other biometric device which have to be used for Aadhaar authentication. However, he emphasised that not all smartphones will require UIDAI registration, and the mandate will only be for devices or phones that want to use Aadhaar authentication."You can come out with any number of devices, but if you want some models to work on Aadhaar authentication then you will have to do this," he explained.Stating that the work on this started almost six months back, he said, "We aways try to look ahead to see what kind of threats can come in future, and how to ensure more security".Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal body responsible for rolling out the Aadhaar programme in the country, has also come out in favour of "incentives" for shopkeepers using the biometric mode for digital transactions, in line with commission given by banks to business correspondents, in a bid to promote Aadhaar-based payment system in rural pockets."If a merchant is using Aadhaar-enabled payment systems then he should be put at par with business correspondent and whatever facility and commission is available to the business correspondent, he should be paid on the same lines," Pandey said.

4)  Demonitisation effect: Most political parties are in a tizzy, but it may not be a level playing field. 
 Monetary losses and electoral gains can make political archenemies speak the same language. Equating the situation emerging out of the demonetisation drive to an "undeclared economic emergency", BSP chief Mayawati said that the BJP move is motivated by selfish interests.Her bete noire and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav , too, termed the situation an emergency, and urged the PM to defer the plan "in the interest of the common man". Clearly, the demonetisation drive has come as bad tidings for the BSP and the SP ahead of the crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.  .......  A level playing field seems to be missing."The Election Commission (EC), which has been on a drive to check the misuse of money during elections, has welcomed the move, though with a shelf life. "Definitely, it will help curb misuse of money during polls but only till the elections in the next few months. With time, parties and people will come up with a new modus operandi," says former chief election commisioner SY Quraishi."The possibility of early distribution of crores of cash in smaller denominations among thousands of voters still exists  we must not remain oblivious to this possibility."

It is an attack on the corrupt, BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told ANI.Alleging that the Congress Party has always sided with the corrupt, he lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modis apt decision.Launching a blistering attack on the government, Gandhi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown how little he cared about the ordinary people of this country.Gandhi said that this decision has thrown farmers, small shopkeepers and housewives into utter chaos. The real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed abroad or in bullion and real estate.How is replacing Rs 1000 notes with Rs 2000 notes going to make black money hoarding a lot harder? he added.Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the government's decision will move the country towards a cashless economy.Reassuring the people that those having lawful money would have nothing to fear, Jaitley said this is a major setback to the parallel black money economy because a lot of currency operating outside the system will now have to be brought into the banking system.The government believes that this decision has been welcomed everywhere. This major step with help India's credibility," he told media in New Delhi.The Finance Minister further said this decision will change the way people spend and keep their money.He also said the decision is of significant advantage to the economy, adding both the Centre and states will benefit from with more revenue accruing in the economic system.

1)  Subsidies in bank account . 
 New Delhi, July 5: The government will provide kerosene, cooking gas and fertiliser subsidies directly to the beneficiaries in seven states from October through banks to plug leaks.The move follows the recommendations of a committee headed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) chairperson Nandan Nilekani that the poor be given subsidies directly.The project will be launched in Tamil Nadu, Assam, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Orissa, according to a UIDAI road map.The pilot project will take around six months. Taking into account the experience, they will submit the final report by the end of this (financial) year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.  .......  Nilekanis panel has left it to the oil ministry to decide the exact numbers. In the second phase, there should be direct cash transfers to the customers bank accounts. In the third, there should be segmentation and targeting of such users.The government spends around Rs 73,637 crore a year on fuel and fertiliser subsidies, but a significant portion does not reach the intended beneficiaries.

2)  UIDAI better than HM’s proposal: Montek. 
 The Planning Commission today said the Nandan Nilekani-led UIDAI project is better than the one being advocated by the Home Ministry for capturing data regarding residents and improving the delivery of the government schemes.We have suggested that what Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is doing is actually better (than the proposal of issuing smart cards), Plan panel Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told reporters on the sidelines of the North-East Business Summit.Under the UIDAI,he said,All the details are centrally stored and you identify the person with (unique) identity number through any secured mobile telephone connection.He was responding to questions on the proposal of the Home Ministry under which a chip-based smart card will be issued to all residents on the basis of record maintained by the National Population Register (NPR)  a digital data base currently under preparation.Home Minister P Chidambaram had earlier said that the data collected by multiple registrars of the UIDAI does not meet the degree of assurance required under the NPR from the point of view of internal security.According to Ahluwalia,There is a big difference between the technology UIDAI is using which is based on the identity number and you will actually have online authentication. You dont have to swipe the card to authenticate yourself.He further said whatever money has been sought for UIDAI will be realised in the form of increased efficiency. if you want a platform to improve the efficiency of government schemes delivery that money is well worth it, hesaid.On duplication of work and extra burden on exchequer,Ahluwalia said,I am not responsible for NPR.  .......  They (Home Ministry) must have given their comments.Asked about why the Commission is so critical about the NPR project,he said,On every project,we often raise issues. This is the job of the Planning Commission to criticise every proposal. This is constructiveway.UIDAI was mandated to issue 200 million Aadhaar numbers or national identity cards to residents by the end of this fiscal.Now Since the UIDAI is about the complete the mandated task,the Commission wants more resources for the authority for continuation of its work and cover remaining residents.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

 Targeting to cover the entire population by March, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said the focus is on identifyinggaps in Aadhaar enrolment, especially in the case of children and senior citizens.We have given Aadhaar to 103.8 crore people...But still there are some gaps in the age group of 0-5 years, 5-18 years and those above 60 years of age, as also certain pockets in the country where the coverage is lesser...so we are focusing on it, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI.On April 4 this year, the UIDAI reached a historic milestone by generating 100 crore Aadhaar numbers within a span of five-and-a-half years.Aadhaar is a 12-digit individual identification number issued by the UIDAI on behalf of the government.New Aadhaar ActThe Centre recently notified the new Aadhaar Act which gives the numbers assigned by it a statutory backing for transfer of subsidies and benefits to people eligible for them.In the last 4 months, we have generated four crore Aadhaar numbers...as we reach a saturation, we have to step-up and identify the people all over the country who are yet to be enrolled, Mr. Pandey said.For children in the age group of 0-5 years, the UIDAI will leverage hospitals, Anganwadis and playschools, as well as the health machinery (which is used to administer vaccination to small children) for Aadhaar enrolment.Camps in schoolsSimilarly, camps will be held in schools for enrolment of children in 5-18 years age group, as well as senior citizens.We are actively working with education departments to see such camps are held in the schools, he said, adding: Even senior citizens and adults who have not got their Aadhaar numbers can come to camps in schools to get enrolled.We have been given a target and mandate to cover the entire population by March 2017 and we will cover it.  .......

4)  'Anti-Dalit' BJP has created emergency-like situation with currency ban: Mayawati. 
 LUCKNOW: Lambasting the Centres move to ban 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes as part of efforts to crackdown on black money and terror financing, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Thursday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA regime has created an emergency-like situation in the country.Dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modis decision of currency denomination as a selfish act, the BSP chief asked as to why the government didnt take this step in the first two years of its rule.The Prime Minister's decision is a bit selfish.

To hide their inefficiency, economic emergency like situations have been created by the government as elections in Uttar Pradesh are coming close, she added.Asserting that the government is trying to deviate the attention from its failures, Mayawati further stated that only the people from Gujarat and Mumbai are benefited from this initiative taken by Prime Minister Modi.The government is trying to deviate the attention from its failures.  .......  Now, after 15 years there was a need to revive the currency as the value of rupee has depreciated, he added.Das further said the RBI is going to closely monitor and regulate the release of Rs. 2000 note, adding the central bank will in due course infuse notes of Rs. 1000 in the market with a new design, dimension and color combination, which will look different from the old ones.The Economic Affairs Secretary further said all denomination of notes will be reintroduced with new design and new features in the coming months.

2)  Direct cash transfer to curb wastages, leakages: PM. 
 NEW DELHI: Centre's ambitious direct cash transfer scheme will help in better targeting of subsidies and reducing delay in delivery of benefits besides curbing wastages and leakages, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday.Addressing the 8th Civil Services Day, Singh said his government has made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in public works.He also said the government needs to make full use of new and modern technology not only in delivery of public services but in governance in general."A good example of such use is the Aadhar programme for providing all the residents of our country a unique identity, and also the Direct Benefits Transfer scheme based on Aadhar numbers that our government launched a few months back...."It will lead to better targeting of subsidies and reducing delays in the delivery of benefits such as scholarships and pensions to the intended beneficiaries. It will also help in curbing wastages and leakages, and result in greater financial inclusion," Singh said.The Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme now covers 121 districts of the country."I think it is also important to recognise the fact that the programmes like the Direct Benefits Scheme also give a sense of empowerment to the people, increase their faith in the processes of governance and therefore have a far larger positive effect than can be measured by the direct advantages they give," he said asking the bureaucrats, involved directly or indirectly in its implementation, to ensure the scheme is a success.  .......  "Our government has also made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in the work of public authorities. There are several legislative initiatives that we have taken in this regard, for example the Right to Information Act, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill and the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. "These are intended to also help in improving the standards of delivery of public services in our country," the PM said.

Taking into account the experience, they will submit the final report by the end of this (financial) year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.  .......  Nilekanis panel has left it to the oil ministry to decide the exact numbers. In the second phase, there should be direct cash transfers to the customers bank accounts.

 New Delhi, Apr 7, 2017 (PTI) 11:09 ISTTo avoid a repeat of Dhoni-like episodes, the UIDAI has instructed the staff of its enrolment agencies to resist the urge of posing for selfies with celebrities or retaining their Aadhaar details.

Of course, we have taken action against the operator, that the operator should not have done this," he said.Pandey said he would also advise individuals enrolling for Aadhaar to decline such requests. "We will also request people who are getting enrolled that this is a serious official visit. At least, during the process, please strictly conform to the norms and if someone requests for a copy of the receipt or operator requests for selfie, they should deny it," he said.As per the latest update, more than 113 crore Aadhaar IDs have been generated in the country and Aadhaar authentications have crossed the 500 crore mark, while 100 crore e-KYCs have been done on the platform.
