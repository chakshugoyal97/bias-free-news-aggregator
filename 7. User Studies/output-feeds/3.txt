3)  Aadhaar mandatory for filing Income Tax returns to avoid tax evasion: Arun Jaitley. 
 NEW DELHI: Making Aadhaar number mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns is necessary to curb tax evasion and frauds, the government said today while rejecting the opposition demand for a relook at the move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley replied in the affirmative when a BJD member questioned in the Lok Sabha whether the government was "forcing" the people to have Aadhaar number by making it mandatory.He, however, ruled out imposing any tax on agriculture income, saying it is a state matter.He was replying to a debate on the Finance Bill 2017, which was later passed by the House along with 40 official amendments, including the one on reducing the cap on cash transactions from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 2 lakh from April 1.Just before the bill was passed, BJD members staged a walkout over the Aadhaar issue while Congress members walked out as the government gave no commitment to waive farm loans.The amendments also included the merger of tribunals of different ministries and a proposal for launching electoral bonds.Jaitley said the cap on cash transactions is being reduced to curb generation of black money and the move to introduce electoral bonds is for cleansing the political funding."To encourage digital economy and to discourage cash economy, I had proposed in Budget that there will be a ban on cash transactions of over Rs 3 lakh. I am making it Rs 2 lakh by an amendment," he said.On cleansing of political funding, he asked the political parties to give "advice", saying the government will consider all the suggestions while drafting the final policy on this.To make electoral funding clean and transparent, the Budget had proposed that funding should be in the form of digital or cheque and cash donations be limited to Rs 2,000.  .......  There is no tax on agriculture and it won't be levied."During the discussion on the finance bill, Mahtab had raised the issue of imposition of tax on agriculture income.Jaitley said the government will achieve the tax collection target of a "record" Rs 17 lakh crore as provided in the Revised Estimate.Hoping that Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be introduced from July 1, Jaitley said a consensus has been arrived at between the Centre and states on most of the contentious issues in the GST Council meeting."The government will bring before Parliament four GST legislations and there will be a fifth legislation as the Excise and Customs Acts will have to be amended. We will bring these legislations together to Parliament in the next few days," he said.The GST Council has already cleared five legislations-- CGST, IGST, UTGST, GST Compensation Law and the SGST. The Union Cabinet earlier this week cleared the Central GST (CGST), Integrated GST (IGST), Union Territory GST (UTGST) and the Compensation law.

1)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

As mobile devices are already loaded with data, there is no need for additional instrument and other manufacturers having access to this data, he said.DH News Service

4)  Oppn protests over demonetisation, disrupts LS proceedings. 
 Oppn protests over demonetisation, disrupts LS proceedingsNew Delhi, Nov 30, 2016 (PTI) 16:32 ISTOpposition today said it is ready for a debate on demonetisation in the Lok Sabha under any rule that entailed voting but the government refused to budge from its stand against division of votes as the impasse in the House continued, causing frequent adjournments.The House saw two adjournments due to the noisy protests before Speaker Sumitra Mahajan called it a day.When the House assembled in the morning, Opposition members raised slogans and rushed into the Well demanding a debate on demonetisation under rules which entail voting, forcing an adjournment till noon.After the House reassembled, leaders of several Opposition parties, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong) and Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC), said they were willing to withdraw their demand that the debate be held under Rule 56, which deals with an adjournment motion, and said the government should also not insist on Rule 193 which does not involve voting at the end of the debate.BJD also sided with the Opposition and rejected the government's contention with its leader Bhartruhari Mahtab saying the division of votes was not on black money but the hardships facing people and states following the decision.Kharge told the Speaker "you decide on any rule that involves discussion and voting. We are ready. We are not running away from debate." He drew support from Bandopadhyay.Expressing the government's view, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the people stood with the Narendra Modi government on its action against black money and a divided message should not go out of Parliament on the issue."It should not appear that Parliament is against the measures being taken against black money," he said.Taking a dig at the government, Mahtab wondered who is dividing Parliament."It is neither the Leader of Opposition, nor the TMC leader...  .......  Every citizen, every state is going through hardships," he said, noting that his party has supported the demonetisation move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said if the debate is about hardships facing people, then there is no need for division of votes and the debate should start immediately.Mahajan suggested that a debate should begin in the Zero Hour and Parliament will try to find "something out of the zero" as both sides are divide on rules.However, the Opposition members trooped into the Well as it became clear that the government was not agreeable to their demand."It shows you don't want discussion," the Speaker said as she adjourned the House till 1245 hours.Before adjourning the House till 1245 hours, the Speaker took up Zero Hour asking members to raise issues of national importance. However, nothing was audbile in the din.When the proceedings resumed, the Opposition again raised the demand of dicussion to be held under rules which entails voting.Mahajan said "I have given you one chance. I am ready to allow you (to proceed with the debate)."However, the dissatisfied Opposition members stormed into the Well again and amidst continued sloganeering, the House was adjourned for the day.Earlier in the day, members of most of the opposition parties had staged a walk out after their demand for an obituary reference on the soldiers who died in the terror attack on army camp in Jammu was rejected by the Speaker on the grounds that final details were yet to emerge.

 NEW DELHI: Your Aadhaar card could soon become a universal payment ID. In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI).  .......  The results are very encouraging," Pandey had told ET earlier.The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

Over 10 lakh to 1 crore cards have been held back," said Ashok Dalwai.PAY FOR CHANGE OF ADDRESS?As of now, self-updation, like change of address, is free of cost, but there are chances of a nominal fee being charged for the service. "The fee structure depends on the registrars who've tied up with the UID. A nominal fee would be collected for such service soon," he said.

4)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

UIDAI wants mobile and device manufacturers to use the Aadhaar-enabled biometric authentication.  .......  Gradually, Android devices and Apple phones are coming up with fingerprint and iris scanner in their phones itself, he said.At present, the government requests that all mobiles sold in India should be Aadhaar compliant so that they can be used effectively. It is a very good and valid idea, and the government should take it forward. As mobile devices are already loaded with data, there is no need for additional instrument and other manufacturers having access to this data, he said.DH News Service

1)  PM’s demonetisation drive aimed at fulfilling BJP’s ‘political interest’, says Mayawati. 
 BSP chief Mayawati (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) BSP chief Mayawati (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government announced the demonetisation drive to fulfil their political interest in the wake of upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Mayawati while addressing a press conference dared Prime Minister Modi to come to the Parliament and face the opposition parties if he has guts.Watch What Else is Making NewsIf anybody is suffering due to demonetisation then it is the poor, the honest and middle class. This step has been taken by the BJP to fulfil their political interest.  .......  1,000 notes.The ruling dispensation has said that Prime Minister Modi will not contribute in the Rajya Sabha, where the government is in a minority. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that he is ready to explain the governments stand, but the opposition is preventing that because it wants to stall Parliament rather than engage in discussion. The opposition is running away from a debate, he said.In the Lok Sabha, the Congress and some other opposition parties insisted on a discussion on demonetisation under Rule 56, which entails voting and through an adjournment motion that implies suspension of all other business.Prime Minister Modi has said that the ban on high value currency notes is not to agonise anyone but to clean the economy.Speaking on demonetisation after launching the Pradhanmantri Grameen Awas Yojna, an ambitious housing scheme meant for the rural poor, in Agra on Monday, the Prime Minister said more than five lakh crore cash has been deposited in banks since last ten days.He thanked the people for bearing the pain of high value note ban.Prime Minister Modi said his decision to demonetise high value currency notes is punishment for those who has accumulated huge black money.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

2)  'Cabinet may look into NPR, UID work duplication'. 
 NEW DELHI: Planning Commission will urge the Cabinet to resolve the issue of duplication of work between Nandan Nilekani-led Unique Identification Authority and National Population Register of the Census Office.NPR has the mandate to provide biometric-based identity cards while the UID authority was asked to provide unique identity numbers to all residents.Earlier, the understanding was that NPR would share its data with UID authority and vice-versa but later, Registrar General of India (RGI) refused to use the UIDAI's data."We are going to discuss the issue in Cabinet," deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia said, adding that UID project was crucial to extend benefits of welfare schemes to common man and the government was keen to roll it out quickly.He also tried to put to rest the controversy over differences between the plan panel and UIDAI over financial and executive autonomy the latter."UIDAI is getting our full support. We have resolved all issues related to financial and executive authority of the body and it has been approved by the finance ministry," Ahluwalia said.The controversy had erupted after plan panel member-secretary Sudha Pillai reportedly expressed reservations over UIDAI's functioning.  .......  Nilekani later clarified that UIDAI was working under a set government framework and on the basis of powers delegated to it by the prime minister. Nilekani also said giving IDs to people was a government project and it was open to scrutiny by Parliament, CAG, CVC or CBI.However, Ahluwalia said, "UIDAI has to get periodic approval (from government)."The UID authority is tasked with generating Aadhaar unique identity cards and so far it has enrolled 10 crore citizens under the scheme and issued unique identity numbers to five crore people.Under the first phase of the project, the authority is to enroll 20 crore citizens by March 2012. The project aims to provide about 60 crore unique identification numbers by 2014.The UPA government's ambitious project, which was launched in September 2010, aims to improve implementation of welfare schemes.Nilekani said Aadhaar identity cards were accepted as valid documents under the Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts, securing mobile connections and getting cooking gas connections.

3)  UIDAI registration for all Aadhaar authentication devices soon. 
 NEW DELHI: UIDAI is expected to make it compulsory, in the next 4-5 months, for all biometric devices using Aadhaar authentication to embed Aadhaar encryption key into the device at the time of manufacturing.Today, all such devices are STQC certified but registration by way of embedding the encryption key of UIDAI will add another security layer to the hardware at a time when such devices are all set to take the centre stage in biometric-based digital payments."We are going to say that in India only registered devices will work (for Aadhaar authentication). If you want to use Aadhaar authentication, then your devices will have to be registered with us," Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI told PTI.Pandey said that the registration with UIDAI implied that the device will be embedded with Aadhaar encryption key of UIDAI at manufacturing stage itself.  .......  We are now going one step further, we are going to put our encryption key in every device. All devices will have to be registered by us, it will further add to the security," he said.Asked about the timeframe in which UIDAI will mandate the same, Pandey said, "in the next 4-5 months." He said the same would hold true for smartphones or any other biometric device which have to be used for Aadhaar authentication. However, he emphasised that not all smartphones will require UIDAI registration, and the mandate will only be for devices or phones that want to use Aadhaar authentication."You can come out with any number of devices, but if you want some models to work on Aadhaar authentication then you will have to do this," he explained.Stating that the work on this started almost six months back, he said, "We aways try to look ahead to see what kind of threats can come in future, and how to ensure more security".Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal body responsible for rolling out the Aadhaar programme in the country, has also come out in favour of "incentives" for shopkeepers using the biometric mode for digital transactions, in line with commission given by banks to business correspondents, in a bid to promote Aadhaar-based payment system in rural pockets."If a merchant is using Aadhaar-enabled payment systems then he should be put at par with business correspondent and whatever facility and commission is available to the business correspondent, he should be paid on the same lines," Pandey said.

4)  Demonitisation effect: Most political parties are in a tizzy, but it may not be a level playing field. 
 Monetary losses and electoral gains can make political archenemies speak the same language. Equating the situation emerging out of the demonetisation drive to an "undeclared economic emergency", BSP chief Mayawati said that the BJP move is motivated by selfish interests.Her bete noire and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav , too, termed the situation an emergency, and urged the PM to defer the plan "in the interest of the common man". Clearly, the demonetisation drive has come as bad tidings for the BSP and the SP ahead of the crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.  .......  A level playing field seems to be missing."The Election Commission (EC), which has been on a drive to check the misuse of money during elections, has welcomed the move, though with a shelf life. "Definitely, it will help curb misuse of money during polls but only till the elections in the next few months. With time, parties and people will come up with a new modus operandi," says former chief election commisioner SY Quraishi."The possibility of early distribution of crores of cash in smaller denominations among thousands of voters still exists  we must not remain oblivious to this possibility."

Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said.Apart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency.  .......

1)  UIDAI better than HM’s proposal: Montek. 
 The Planning Commission today said the Nandan Nilekani-led UIDAI project is better than the one being advocated by the Home Ministry for capturing data regarding residents and improving the delivery of the government schemes.We have suggested that what Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is doing is actually better (than the proposal of issuing smart cards), Plan panel Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told reporters on the sidelines of the North-East Business Summit.Under the UIDAI,he said,All the details are centrally stored and you identify the person with (unique) identity number through any secured mobile telephone connection.He was responding to questions on the proposal of the Home Ministry under which a chip-based smart card will be issued to all residents on the basis of record maintained by the National Population Register (NPR)  a digital data base currently under preparation.Home Minister P Chidambaram had earlier said that the data collected by multiple registrars of the UIDAI does not meet the degree of assurance required under the NPR from the point of view of internal security.According to Ahluwalia,There is a big difference between the technology UIDAI is using which is based on the identity number and you will actually have online authentication. You dont have to swipe the card to authenticate yourself.He further said whatever money has been sought for UIDAI will be realised in the form of increased efficiency. if you want a platform to improve the efficiency of government schemes delivery that money is well worth it, hesaid.On duplication of work and extra burden on exchequer,Ahluwalia said,I am not responsible for NPR.  .......  They (Home Ministry) must have given their comments.Asked about why the Commission is so critical about the NPR project,he said,On every project,we often raise issues. This is the job of the Planning Commission to criticise every proposal. This is constructiveway.UIDAI was mandated to issue 200 million Aadhaar numbers or national identity cards to residents by the end of this fiscal.Now Since the UIDAI is about the complete the mandated task,the Commission wants more resources for the authority for continuation of its work and cover remaining residents.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

2)  Don’t overdraw from ATMs: Das.

3)  Nandan Nilekani joins Modi’s bid to make India a cashless society. 
 PM Narendra Modi has roped in UIDAI chairman and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani for help in handling the transition from a hard cash society to a cashless one, to ease the woes of demonetisation. According to a Bloomberg report, Nilekani, a high-profile Congress member, has joined a panel to chart out a path to digital payments.The 13-member committee headed by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu met for the first time last week, after which in an interview, Nilekani said, India has the underlying digital financial architecture in place to get this going.Nilekani, along with the other panel members, is working out ways to get more Indians to adopt digital mode of payments, by making use of their own smartphones and increasing the availability and use point-of-sale machines in local villages.The committee is currently focusing on two key aspects: getting more merchants to accept the United Payments Interface that has already been rolled out by major banks earlier this year in April, and procuring more point-of-sale devices.The interface makes transferring money as easy as sending a text message.  .......  While suggesting that each category of phone users should have a different strategy, Nilekani said that while India has 250 million smartphone users, there are about 350 million who only have feature phones while another 350 million dont have a phone at all.The real challenge is the 350 million people without phones, many of whom are poor. The plan is to attract all those enrolled in Aadhaar, and enlist the remaining, toward micro ATMs promoted by large Indian lenders which already have a presence in 1,30,000 village retail outlets or kirana stores. There is a sense of urgency, said Nilekani.

4)  Cash deposit limit in Jan-Dhan accounts set at Rs 50,000: Finance Ministry.

Up to Rs 50,000 can be deposited in Jan-Dhan accounts," Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told reporters here.The decision was taken after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a second review meeting on Monday night on demonetisation with officials of the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).Das said the legitimate Jan-Dhan account holders would not be put to any kind of difficulty.  .......  However, the source of deposits of above Rs 50,000 into these accounts will be verified, he added."A close watch is being kept on them (deposits in Jan-Dhan accounts)," he said.Das said, "Jan-Dhan account holders should not allow other people to use their accounts to convert their black money into white. Banks have been advised to keep a close watch on cash movement."For other accounts, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had earlier said that the administration will not bother to make inquiry into small deposits of Rs 1.5-2 lakh.At the review meet, it was also decided that bank counters will use indelible ink from Tuesday in major cities to prevent people from making more than the permissible number of times cash withdrawal.At the moment, the daily withdrawal limit from ATMs is Rs 2,500, and exchange of old notes from bank counters is Rs 4,500. This apart, the upper limit for weekly withdrawal from bank accounts stands at Rs 24,000.

1)  Subsidies in bank account . 
 New Delhi, July 5: The government will provide kerosene, cooking gas and fertiliser subsidies directly to the beneficiaries in seven states from October through banks to plug leaks.The move follows the recommendations of a committee headed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) chairperson Nandan Nilekani that the poor be given subsidies directly.The project will be launched in Tamil Nadu, Assam, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Orissa, according to a UIDAI road map.The pilot project will take around six months. Taking into account the experience, they will submit the final report by the end of this (financial) year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.  .......

1)  Direct cash transfer to curb wastages, leakages: PM. 
 NEW DELHI: Centre's ambitious direct cash transfer scheme will help in better targeting of subsidies and reducing delay in delivery of benefits besides curbing wastages and leakages, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday.Addressing the 8th Civil Services Day, Singh said his government has made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in public works.He also said the government needs to make full use of new and modern technology not only in delivery of public services but in governance in general."A good example of such use is the Aadhar programme for providing all the residents of our country a unique identity, and also the Direct Benefits Transfer scheme based on Aadhar numbers that our government launched a few months back...."It will lead to better targeting of subsidies and reducing delays in the delivery of benefits such as scholarships and pensions to the intended beneficiaries. It will also help in curbing wastages and leakages, and result in greater financial inclusion," Singh said.The Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme now covers 121 districts of the country."I think it is also important to recognise the fact that the programmes like the Direct Benefits Scheme also give a sense of empowerment to the people, increase their faith in the processes of governance and therefore have a far larger positive effect than can be measured by the direct advantages they give," he said asking the bureaucrats, involved directly or indirectly in its implementation, to ensure the scheme is a success.  .......  "Our government has also made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in the work of public authorities. There are several legislative initiatives that we have taken in this regard, for example the Right to Information Act, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill and the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. "These are intended to also help in improving the standards of delivery of public services in our country," the PM said.

2)  Govt. tries to ease cash flow. 
 The exemption deadline for all those services eligible to accept the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has been extended till the midnight of November 24, the government announced on Monday.The waiver of toll tax at 365 plazas on national highways will continue till the midnight of November 18.  .......  The focus of the government is to activate all channels where cash is dispensed.In this regard, the government has instructed banks to increase the cash holding limit of banking correspondents (BCs) to at least Rs. 50,000 each and to replenish the cash with the BCs multiple times in a day, if needed.The accompanying graphic inadvertently included private hospitals in the list of services accepting old notes till Nov. 24.

3)  Aadhaar before name for Gurgaon babies. 
 GURUGRAM: Amit Singh's son was born at Gurgaon's civil hospital on April 28. He has yet to name his son, but the baby already has an Aadhaar number.Within hours of his son's birth, the hospital staff arrived with Aadhaar officials, camera in hand, and requested to take the infant's picture."They collected photocopies of my Aadhaar card and documents and gave us a receipt with the 12-digit identity number," said Singh.  .......  Earlier, children were not registered for Aadhaar because up to the age of five years, a child's biometric data like fingerprints keep changing."Under the new rules, children were allowed to have Aadhaar registration even if they had no name. Their biometric details are now captured after the age of six years. The UIADI website says, "If an Aadhaar Card of a child below the age of five years is created, it will be linked to the parent's Aadhaar Card."But while the civil hospital has an Aadhaar centre, in Gurgaon's private hospitals, parents click their newborn's picture - on camera or phone - and share it with the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon to issue them both an Aadhaar and a birth certificate.

4)  India tells automobile companies to ensure RFID tag for toll payment. 
 New Delhi, Nov. 23 (PTI): The government has asked automobile manufacturers to provide a digital identity tag in all new vehicles, including cars, to enable electronic payment at all toll plazas and ensure seamless movement at check posts.  .......  It will be an option that will be provided and instead of issuing a check or a demand draft, you can make payment through online transactions. All these measures are meant to promote digital penetration. It will help farmers in current Rabi season to ensure normal rabi crops on the back of a good monsoon, he added.

4)  Kashmir encounter shows demonetisation failed: Capt Amarinder. 
 A day after four militants were killed in Kashmir, Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said despite the Narendra Modi governments claims, note ban has failed to check flow of terrorists and fake currency from Pakistan.In a statement issued here, Amarinder said Sundays encounter in Kashmir and reports of Pakistan pushing fake Rs 2,000 currency into India via Bangladesh were proof that the ill-conceived note ban decision was not helping curb terror as claimed by Modi. Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said.Apart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency.  .......
