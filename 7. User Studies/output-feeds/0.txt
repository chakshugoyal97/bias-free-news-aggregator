3)  Aadhaar mandatory for filing Income Tax returns to avoid tax evasion: Arun Jaitley. 
 NEW DELHI: Making Aadhaar number mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns is necessary to curb tax evasion and frauds, the government said today while rejecting the opposition demand for a relook at the move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley replied in the affirmative when a BJD member questioned in the Lok Sabha whether the government was "forcing" the people to have Aadhaar number by making it mandatory.He, however, ruled out imposing any tax on agriculture income, saying it is a state matter.He was replying to a debate on the Finance Bill 2017, which was later passed by the House along with 40 official amendments, including the one on reducing the cap on cash transactions from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 2 lakh from April 1.Just before the bill was passed, BJD members staged a walkout over the Aadhaar issue while Congress members walked out as the government gave no commitment to waive farm loans.The amendments also included the merger of tribunals of different ministries and a proposal for launching electoral bonds.Jaitley said the cap on cash transactions is being reduced to curb generation of black money and the move to introduce electoral bonds is for cleansing the political funding."To encourage digital economy and to discourage cash economy, I had proposed in Budget that there will be a ban on cash transactions of over Rs 3 lakh. I am making it Rs 2 lakh by an amendment," he said.On cleansing of political funding, he asked the political parties to give "advice", saying the government will consider all the suggestions while drafting the final policy on this.To make electoral funding clean and transparent, the Budget had proposed that funding should be in the form of digital or cheque and cash donations be limited to Rs 2,000.  .......  There is no tax on agriculture and it won't be levied."During the discussion on the finance bill, Mahtab had raised the issue of imposition of tax on agriculture income.Jaitley said the government will achieve the tax collection target of a "record" Rs 17 lakh crore as provided in the Revised Estimate.Hoping that Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be introduced from July 1, Jaitley said a consensus has been arrived at between the Centre and states on most of the contentious issues in the GST Council meeting."The government will bring before Parliament four GST legislations and there will be a fifth legislation as the Excise and Customs Acts will have to be amended. We will bring these legislations together to Parliament in the next few days," he said.The GST Council has already cleared five legislations-- CGST, IGST, UTGST, GST Compensation Law and the SGST. The Union Cabinet earlier this week cleared the Central GST (CGST), Integrated GST (IGST), Union Territory GST (UTGST) and the Compensation law.

1)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

 No high quality fake currency notes have been recovered post demonetisation, although some scanned or photocopied notes were seized by BSF and NIA at the Indo-Bangladesh border, Parliament was informed today.Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal said the government has been taking a host of steps, including setting up of a special cell in the Home Ministry, to deal with the menace of FICN (Fake Indian Currency Notes).In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Meghwal said: No high quality FICN has been recovered post demonetisation.The government had scrapped old currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 on November 8, and replaced them with new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes.As regards seizure of FICN of 2,000 denomination by BSF and NIA on the Indo-Bangladesh border, Meghwal said: The forensic lab had reported the use of stamp paper in printing these notes.  .......  The forensic lab had reported the use of stamp paper in printing these notes. These notes have been scanned/photocopied. Examination of the specific parameters reveals that the notes are of low quality.The government on its part, he added, has taken various measures to combat terror funding and check smuggling and circulation of fake notes.These initiatives including setting up of a special Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) cell in the Home Ministry of coordinate with the central intelligence/ enforcement agencies and state law enforcement agencies for an integrated approach to tackle the problem.Also, he added, a Terror Funding and Fake Currency Cell (TFFC) has been constituted in the NIA (National Investigation Agency) to investigate terror funding and fake currency cases.In addition, he said, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Indian and Bangladesh to prevent and counter smuggling of fake notes into the country.Replying to another question on the same subject, the minister said that new design banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) series have been introduced in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 to check counterfeiting.Incorporating new security features/new designs in the bank notes to stay ahead of the counterfeiters is an ongoing process, said Meghwal, adding that the new series notes will also be introduced in notes of other denominations in due course.

4)  Oppn protests over demonetisation, disrupts LS proceedings. 
 Oppn protests over demonetisation, disrupts LS proceedingsNew Delhi, Nov 30, 2016 (PTI) 16:32 ISTOpposition today said it is ready for a debate on demonetisation in the Lok Sabha under any rule that entailed voting but the government refused to budge from its stand against division of votes as the impasse in the House continued, causing frequent adjournments.The House saw two adjournments due to the noisy protests before Speaker Sumitra Mahajan called it a day.When the House assembled in the morning, Opposition members raised slogans and rushed into the Well demanding a debate on demonetisation under rules which entail voting, forcing an adjournment till noon.After the House reassembled, leaders of several Opposition parties, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong) and Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC), said they were willing to withdraw their demand that the debate be held under Rule 56, which deals with an adjournment motion, and said the government should also not insist on Rule 193 which does not involve voting at the end of the debate.BJD also sided with the Opposition and rejected the government's contention with its leader Bhartruhari Mahtab saying the division of votes was not on black money but the hardships facing people and states following the decision.Kharge told the Speaker "you decide on any rule that involves discussion and voting. We are ready. We are not running away from debate." He drew support from Bandopadhyay.Expressing the government's view, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the people stood with the Narendra Modi government on its action against black money and a divided message should not go out of Parliament on the issue."It should not appear that Parliament is against the measures being taken against black money," he said.Taking a dig at the government, Mahtab wondered who is dividing Parliament."It is neither the Leader of Opposition, nor the TMC leader...  .......  Every citizen, every state is going through hardships," he said, noting that his party has supported the demonetisation move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said if the debate is about hardships facing people, then there is no need for division of votes and the debate should start immediately.Mahajan suggested that a debate should begin in the Zero Hour and Parliament will try to find "something out of the zero" as both sides are divide on rules.However, the Opposition members trooped into the Well as it became clear that the government was not agreeable to their demand."It shows you don't want discussion," the Speaker said as she adjourned the House till 1245 hours.Before adjourning the House till 1245 hours, the Speaker took up Zero Hour asking members to raise issues of national importance. However, nothing was audbile in the din.When the proceedings resumed, the Opposition again raised the demand of dicussion to be held under rules which entails voting.Mahajan said "I have given you one chance. I am ready to allow you (to proceed with the debate)."However, the dissatisfied Opposition members stormed into the Well again and amidst continued sloganeering, the House was adjourned for the day.Earlier in the day, members of most of the opposition parties had staged a walk out after their demand for an obituary reference on the soldiers who died in the terror attack on army camp in Jammu was rejected by the Speaker on the grounds that final details were yet to emerge.

 NEW DELHI: President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday said that the Aadhar card initiative is a watershed event in the development of the country. He urged upon the people to support the campaign of the government for the less cash society.Speaking at the 100th mega draw of lots for Lucky Grahak Yojna and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojna at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the President stressed that efforts of the government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them proactively.  .......  Even countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place, said Mukherjee, while complimenting the government for promotion of digital transactions.After the November 8 announcement of the decision on demonetization, the NITI Aayog had launched two schemes - Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and the Digidhan Vyapar Yojana for the merchants.The President picked up six lucky winners on the final day of the 100 day scheme.

1)  Govt to integrate BHIM app with Aadhaar for transactions. 
 NEW DELHI: Your Aadhaar card could soon become a universal payment ID. In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI).  .......  The results are very encouraging," Pandey had told ET earlier.The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

 BANGALORE: If you are one of those waiting for your Aadhaar card, log on to the UIDAI website, key in your enrolment number and take a print of your e-Aadhaar card.

Over 10 lakh to 1 crore cards have been held back," said Ashok Dalwai.PAY FOR CHANGE OF ADDRESS?As of now, self-updation, like change of address, is free of cost, but there are chances of a nominal fee being charged for the service. "The fee structure depends on the registrars who've tied up with the UID. A nominal fee would be collected for such service soon," he said.

 Two crore unique Aadhaar numbers generated in OctoberLast updated: 01 November, 2011New Delhi, Nov 1 (PTI) 15:17 ISTThe UIDAI, which issues national identity cards to citizens, today said it generated two crore Aadhaar numbers in the month of October."In another major milestone, the Unique Identification Development Authority of India (UIDAI) has generated two crore Aadhaar numbers in the month of October, 2011, alone," an official statement said.The UIDAI launched the Aadhaar scheme in September last year and the authority was to issue 200 million national identity cards bearing unique numbers by end-March, 2012."While in 2010, it took three months to cross the one million-mark, we have the capability to generate that many Aadhaar cards in a day now. We would work on stabilising and consolidating this capability in the coming days.  .......  01 November, 2011New Delhi, Nov 1 (PTI) 15:17 ISTThe UIDAI, which issues national identity cards to citizens, today said it generated two crore Aadhaar numbers in the month of October."In another major milestone, the Unique Identification Development Authority of India (UIDAI) has generated two crore Aadhaar numbers in the month of October, 2011, alone," an official statement said.The UIDAI launched the Aadhaar scheme in September last year and the authority was to issue 200 million national identity cards bearing unique numbers by end-March, 2012."While in 2010, it took three months to cross the one million-mark, we have the capability to generate that many Aadhaar cards in a day now. We would work on stabilising and consolidating this capability in the coming days. We have been able to achieve this speed and scale due to our multiple registrar model, as well as scalable technical architecture," UIDAI Chairman Nandan Nilekani said.At present, there are around 20,000 enrollment stations across the country being run by about 50 registrars for registration of citizens under the scheme.The UIDAI has generated 59.6 million crore Aadhaar numbers in a short span of a little more than a year and more than 100 million citizens have enrolled themselves in the system across the country, the statement said.

2)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

UIDAI wants mobile and device manufacturers to use the Aadhaar-enabled biometric authentication.  .......

It is a very good and valid idea, and the government should take it forward. As mobile devices are already loaded with data, there is no need for additional instrument and other manufacturers having access to this data, he said.DH News Service

2)  'Cabinet may look into NPR, UID work duplication'. 
 NEW DELHI: Planning Commission will urge the Cabinet to resolve the issue of duplication of work between Nandan Nilekani-led Unique Identification Authority and National Population Register of the Census Office.NPR has the mandate to provide biometric-based identity cards while the UID authority was asked to provide unique identity numbers to all residents.Earlier, the understanding was that NPR would share its data with UID authority and vice-versa but later, Registrar General of India (RGI) refused to use the UIDAI's data."We are going to discuss the issue in Cabinet," deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia said, adding that UID project was crucial to extend benefits of welfare schemes to common man and the government was keen to roll it out quickly.He also tried to put to rest the controversy over differences between the plan panel and UIDAI over financial and executive autonomy the latter."UIDAI is getting our full support. We have resolved all issues related to financial and executive authority of the body and it has been approved by the finance ministry," Ahluwalia said.The controversy had erupted after plan panel member-secretary Sudha Pillai reportedly expressed reservations over UIDAI's functioning.  .......  Nilekani later clarified that UIDAI was working under a set government framework and on the basis of powers delegated to it by the prime minister. Nilekani also said giving IDs to people was a government project and it was open to scrutiny by Parliament, CAG, CVC or CBI.However, Ahluwalia said, "UIDAI has to get periodic approval (from government)."The UID authority is tasked with generating Aadhaar unique identity cards and so far it has enrolled 10 crore citizens under the scheme and issued unique identity numbers to five crore people.Under the first phase of the project, the authority is to enroll 20 crore citizens by March 2012. The project aims to provide about 60 crore unique identification numbers by 2014.The UPA government's ambitious project, which was launched in September 2010, aims to improve implementation of welfare schemes.Nilekani said Aadhaar identity cards were accepted as valid documents under the Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts, securing mobile connections and getting cooking gas connections.

3)  UIDAI registration for all Aadhaar authentication devices soon. 
 NEW DELHI: UIDAI is expected to make it compulsory, in the next 4-5 months, for all biometric devices using Aadhaar authentication to embed Aadhaar encryption key into the device at the time of manufacturing.Today, all such devices are STQC certified but registration by way of embedding the encryption key of UIDAI will add another security layer to the hardware at a time when such devices are all set to take the centre stage in biometric-based digital payments."We are going to say that in India only registered devices will work (for Aadhaar authentication). If you want to use Aadhaar authentication, then your devices will have to be registered with us," Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI told PTI.Pandey said that the registration with UIDAI implied that the device will be embedded with Aadhaar encryption key of UIDAI at manufacturing stage itself.  .......  We are now going one step further, we are going to put our encryption key in every device. All devices will have to be registered by us, it will further add to the security," he said.Asked about the timeframe in which UIDAI will mandate the same, Pandey said, "in the next 4-5 months." He said the same would hold true for smartphones or any other biometric device which have to be used for Aadhaar authentication. However, he emphasised that not all smartphones will require UIDAI registration, and the mandate will only be for devices or phones that want to use Aadhaar authentication."You can come out with any number of devices, but if you want some models to work on Aadhaar authentication then you will have to do this," he explained.Stating that the work on this started almost six months back, he said, "We aways try to look ahead to see what kind of threats can come in future, and how to ensure more security".Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal body responsible for rolling out the Aadhaar programme in the country, has also come out in favour of "incentives" for shopkeepers using the biometric mode for digital transactions, in line with commission given by banks to business correspondents, in a bid to promote Aadhaar-based payment system in rural pockets."If a merchant is using Aadhaar-enabled payment systems then he should be put at par with business correspondent and whatever facility and commission is available to the business correspondent, he should be paid on the same lines," Pandey said.

 NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday questioned the ulterior motives of the opposition post Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhis assertion as to how will replacing Rs 1,000 notes with Rs 2,000 notes curb black money, saying this move has brought miseries on the faces of those contesting the polls on black money and backing the corrupt.The decision taken by the government to scarp Rs. 500 and 1,000 notes is a surgical strike on those providing financial assistance to terrorism.  .......  It is an attack on the corrupt, BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told ANI.Alleging that the Congress Party has always sided with the corrupt, he lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modis apt decision.Launching a blistering attack on the government, Gandhi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown how little he cared about the ordinary people of this country.Gandhi said that this decision has thrown farmers, small shopkeepers and housewives into utter chaos. The real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed abroad or in bullion and real estate.How is replacing Rs 1000 notes with Rs 2000 notes going to make black money hoarding a lot harder? he added.Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the government's decision will move the country towards a cashless economy.Reassuring the people that those having lawful money would have nothing to fear, Jaitley said this is a major setback to the parallel black money economy because a lot of currency operating outside the system will now have to be brought into the banking system.The government believes that this decision has been welcomed everywhere. This major step with help India's credibility," he told media in New Delhi.The Finance Minister further said this decision will change the way people spend and keep their money.He also said the decision is of significant advantage to the economy, adding both the Centre and states will benefit from with more revenue accruing in the economic system.

1)  Subsidies in bank account . 
 New Delhi, July 5: The government will provide kerosene, cooking gas and fertiliser subsidies directly to the beneficiaries in seven states from October through banks to plug leaks.The move follows the recommendations of a committee headed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) chairperson Nandan Nilekani that the poor be given subsidies directly.The project will be launched in Tamil Nadu, Assam, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Orissa, according to a UIDAI road map.The pilot project will take around six months. Taking into account the experience, they will submit the final report by the end of this (financial) year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.  .......  Nilekanis panel has left it to the oil ministry to decide the exact numbers. In the second phase, there should be direct cash transfers to the customers bank accounts.

Both of them will be looked into," he said while addressing an event organised by Laghu Udyog Bharti here.Assuring relief to the MSME sector, Meghwal said the next budget will look into their concerns.Spelling out advantages of demonetisation, Meghwal said that it will help lower interest rate.Besides, it is choking the funding to terrorist organisation and flushing out black money from the system.Naxal activities have come down significantly across the country, he added.On the issue of major amount of old Rs 500/1000 currency have come back into the system, he said, it can be said with clarity only after reconciling data.Banks are yet to segregate fake currencies from the deposits that they have got and there are issues of double counting of deposits of banks and post offices.These issues would be cleared after reconciliation takes place, he added.With regard to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Meghwal said the government intends to implement it from April 1."The Constitution does not permit delay in GST implementation.  .......

3)  SC asks what's wrong with Aadhaar-tax link. 
 New Delhi, April 26: The Supreme Court today prima facie found nothing wrong in the Centre's decision to make it mandatory for those filing income tax returns to link their PAN with Aadhaar cards, saying it was a "shame" that many people in the country evaded tax. A bench of Justices A.K.  .......  It can, however, do so for other services such as the opening of bank accounts or the issuance of driving licences, a bench headed by Chief Justice J.S. Khehar had said. It had added that the larger issue of the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar programme, which involves the "right to privacy", would be decided by a seven-judge bench.

4)  Aadhaar mandatory for filing Income Tax returns to avoid tax evasion: Arun Jaitley. 
 NEW DELHI: Making Aadhaar number mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns is necessary to curb tax evasion and frauds, the government said today while rejecting the opposition demand for a relook at the move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley replied in the affirmative when a BJD member questioned in the Lok Sabha whether the government was "forcing" the people to have Aadhaar number by making it mandatory.He, however, ruled out imposing any tax on agriculture income, saying it is a state matter.He was replying to a debate on the Finance Bill 2017, which was later passed by the House along with 40 official amendments, including the one on reducing the cap on cash transactions from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 2 lakh from April 1.Just before the bill was passed, BJD members staged a walkout over the Aadhaar issue while Congress members walked out as the government gave no commitment to waive farm loans.The amendments also included the merger of tribunals of different ministries and a proposal for launching electoral bonds.Jaitley said the cap on cash transactions is being reduced to curb generation of black money and the move to introduce electoral bonds is for cleansing the political funding."To encourage digital economy and to discourage cash economy, I had proposed in Budget that there will be a ban on cash transactions of over Rs 3 lakh. I am making it Rs 2 lakh by an amendment," he said.On cleansing of political funding, he asked the political parties to give "advice", saying the government will consider all the suggestions while drafting the final policy on this.To make electoral funding clean and transparent, the Budget had proposed that funding should be in the form of digital or cheque and cash donations be limited to Rs 2,000.  .......  There is no tax on agriculture and it won't be levied."During the discussion on the finance bill, Mahtab had raised the issue of imposition of tax on agriculture income.Jaitley said the government will achieve the tax collection target of a "record" Rs 17 lakh crore as provided in the Revised Estimate.Hoping that Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be introduced from July 1, Jaitley said a consensus has been arrived at between the Centre and states on most of the contentious issues in the GST Council meeting."The government will bring before Parliament four GST legislations and there will be a fifth legislation as the Excise and Customs Acts will have to be amended. We will bring these legislations together to Parliament in the next few days," he said.The GST Council has already cleared five legislations-- CGST, IGST, UTGST, GST Compensation Law and the SGST. The Union Cabinet earlier this week cleared the Central GST (CGST), Integrated GST (IGST), Union Territory GST (UTGST) and the Compensation law.

3)  Kashmir encounter shows demonetisation failed: Capt Amarinder. 
 A day after four militants were killed in Kashmir, Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said despite the Narendra Modi governments claims, note ban has failed to check flow of terrorists and fake currency from Pakistan.In a statement issued here, Amarinder said Sundays encounter in Kashmir and reports of Pakistan pushing fake Rs 2,000 currency into India via Bangladesh were proof that the ill-conceived note ban decision was not helping curb terror as claimed by Modi. Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said.Apart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency.  .......

1)  “Identifying gaps in Aadhaar enrolment”. 
 Targeting to cover the entire population by March, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said the focus is on identifyinggaps in Aadhaar enrolment, especially in the case of children and senior citizens.We have given Aadhaar to 103.8 crore people...But still there are some gaps in the age group of 0-5 years, 5-18 years and those above 60 years of age, as also certain pockets in the country where the coverage is lesser...so we are focusing on it, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI.On April 4 this year, the UIDAI reached a historic milestone by generating 100 crore Aadhaar numbers within a span of five-and-a-half years.Aadhaar is a 12-digit individual identification number issued by the UIDAI on behalf of the government.New Aadhaar ActThe Centre recently notified the new Aadhaar Act which gives the numbers assigned by it a statutory backing for transfer of subsidies and benefits to people eligible for them.In the last 4 months, we have generated four crore Aadhaar numbers...as we reach a saturation, we have to step-up and identify the people all over the country who are yet to be enrolled, Mr. Pandey said.For children in the age group of 0-5 years, the UIDAI will leverage hospitals, Anganwadis and playschools, as well as the health machinery (which is used to administer vaccination to small children) for Aadhaar enrolment.Camps in schoolsSimilarly, camps will be held in schools for enrolment of children in 5-18 years age group, as well as senior citizens.We are actively working with education departments to see such camps are held in the schools, he said, adding: Even senior citizens and adults who have not got their Aadhaar numbers can come to camps in schools to get enrolled.We have been given a target and mandate to cover the entire population by March 2017 and we will cover it.  .......  Even senior citizens and adults who have not got their Aadhaar numbers can come to camps in schools to get enrolled.We have been given a target and mandate to cover the entire population by March 2017 and we will cover it.

3)  Direct cash transfer to curb wastages, leakages: PM. 
 NEW DELHI: Centre's ambitious direct cash transfer scheme will help in better targeting of subsidies and reducing delay in delivery of benefits besides curbing wastages and leakages, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday.Addressing the 8th Civil Services Day, Singh said his government has made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in public works.He also said the government needs to make full use of new and modern technology not only in delivery of public services but in governance in general."A good example of such use is the Aadhar programme for providing all the residents of our country a unique identity, and also the Direct Benefits Transfer scheme based on Aadhar numbers that our government launched a few months back...."It will lead to better targeting of subsidies and reducing delays in the delivery of benefits such as scholarships and pensions to the intended beneficiaries. It will also help in curbing wastages and leakages, and result in greater financial inclusion," Singh said.The Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme now covers 121 districts of the country."I think it is also important to recognise the fact that the programmes like the Direct Benefits Scheme also give a sense of empowerment to the people, increase their faith in the processes of governance and therefore have a far larger positive effect than can be measured by the direct advantages they give," he said asking the bureaucrats, involved directly or indirectly in its implementation, to ensure the scheme is a success.  .......  "Our government has also made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in the work of public authorities. There are several legislative initiatives that we have taken in this regard, for example the Right to Information Act, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill and the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. "These are intended to also help in improving the standards of delivery of public services in our country," the PM said.

3)  Dhoni case: UIDAI sensitises agencies on celebrity enrolments. 
 New Delhi, Apr 7, 2017 (PTI) 11:09 ISTTo avoid a repeat of Dhoni-like episodes, the UIDAI has instructed the staff of its enrolment agencies to resist the urge of posing for selfies with celebrities or retaining their Aadhaar details. It also emphasised that personal preferences should be kept separate from official duties.The instruction follows the public sharing of Aadhaar details of ace cricketer M S Dhoni after some photos were tweeted by the CSC E-Governance handle, including one capturing his personal details in the form of his Aadhaar acknowledgement slip.Swinging into action, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has reached out to its regional offices to, in turn, sensitise enrolment agencies to "strictly" adhere to the rules of enrolment, even as the erring operator has been blacklisted."We are sensitising all our operators and agencies to strictly follow the norms while enrolling such individuals...and not to mix enrolment operation with personal likes and dislikes...or get into the personal domain like clicking a selfie," UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey told PTI.Pandey's advice to the enrolment agencies: "Please don't be enthusiastic...  .......  Of course, we have taken action against the operator, that the operator should not have done this," he said.Pandey said he would also advise individuals enrolling for Aadhaar to decline such requests. "We will also request people who are getting enrolled that this is a serious official visit. At least, during the process, please strictly conform to the norms and if someone requests for a copy of the receipt or operator requests for selfie, they should deny it," he said.As per the latest update, more than 113 crore Aadhaar IDs have been generated in the country and Aadhaar authentications have crossed the 500 crore mark, while 100 crore e-KYCs have been done on the platform.

4)  No poor will be deprived by making Aadhaar mandatory: Government. 
 NEW DELHI: Accusing the Congress of painting Aadhaar as a curse, the government today asserted that no poor person would be deprived of the subsidy benefits by making the Aadhaar mandatory and that privacy of individuals will be protected.Minister of IT and Law Ravi Shankar Prasad stated this in the Rajya Sabha while replying to a discussion on Aadhaar against the backdrop of concerns expressed by the opposition over making the biometric-based identification system mandatory for availing of government subsidies."I want to make it very clear on the behalf of the govermment that no poor shall be denied his subsidy rights at all. Be very clear about that.  .......  We in the last two years manufactured 12 crore mobiles through 72 factories across the country," he added."We never said they (previous government) did not used to do good work. They used to begin good work but it is our duty to make it better. That is why the people have brought us to power," Prasad said.To improve infrastructure will be the governmt's priority, he added.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien said demographic data of 5 lakh minors was leaked and government should look into the matter."If you protect MS Dhoni, it is good but at the same time, you should also protect small people," he said.
