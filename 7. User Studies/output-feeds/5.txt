 Oppn protests over demonetisation, disrupts LS proceedingsNew Delhi, Nov 30, 2016 (PTI) 16:32 ISTOpposition today said it is ready for a debate on demonetisation in the Lok Sabha under any rule that entailed voting but the government refused to budge from its stand against division of votes as the impasse in the House continued, causing frequent adjournments.The House saw two adjournments due to the noisy protests before Speaker Sumitra Mahajan called it a day.When the House assembled in the morning, Opposition members raised slogans and rushed into the Well demanding a debate on demonetisation under rules which entail voting, forcing an adjournment till noon.After the House reassembled, leaders of several Opposition parties, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong) and Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC), said they were willing to withdraw their demand that the debate be held under Rule 56, which deals with an adjournment motion, and said the government should also not insist on Rule 193 which does not involve voting at the end of the debate.BJD also sided with the Opposition and rejected the government's contention with its leader Bhartruhari Mahtab saying the division of votes was not on black money but the hardships facing people and states following the decision.Kharge told the Speaker "you decide on any rule that involves discussion and voting. We are ready. We are not running away from debate." He drew support from Bandopadhyay.Expressing the government's view, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the people stood with the Narendra Modi government on its action against black money and a divided message should not go out of Parliament on the issue."It should not appear that Parliament is against the measures being taken against black money," he said.Taking a dig at the government, Mahtab wondered who is dividing Parliament."It is neither the Leader of Opposition, nor the TMC leader...  .......  Every citizen, every state is going through hardships," he said, noting that his party has supported the demonetisation move.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said if the debate is about hardships facing people, then there is no need for division of votes and the debate should start immediately.Mahajan suggested that a debate should begin in the Zero Hour and Parliament will try to find "something out of the zero" as both sides are divide on rules.However, the Opposition members trooped into the Well as it became clear that the government was not agreeable to their demand."It shows you don't want discussion," the Speaker said as she adjourned the House till 1245 hours.Before adjourning the House till 1245 hours, the Speaker took up Zero Hour asking members to raise issues of national importance. However, nothing was audbile in the din.When the proceedings resumed, the Opposition again raised the demand of dicussion to be held under rules which entails voting.Mahajan said "I have given you one chance. I am ready to allow you (to proceed with the debate)."However, the dissatisfied Opposition members stormed into the Well again and amidst continued sloganeering, the House was adjourned for the day.Earlier in the day, members of most of the opposition parties had staged a walk out after their demand for an obituary reference on the soldiers who died in the terror attack on army camp in Jammu was rejected by the Speaker on the grounds that final details were yet to emerge.

In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI).  .......  The results are very encouraging," Pandey had told ET earlier.The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

2)  UID not delivered? Take a print of your e-Aadhaar. 
 BANGALORE: If you are one of those waiting for your Aadhaar card, log on to the UIDAI website, key in your enrolment number and take a print of your e-Aadhaar card. This, according to UID deputy director general Ashok Dalwai, is as valid as having a card.With lakhs of Aadhaar applicants waiting for months, and in some cases years, to get their Unique Identity card, the UID chief in Karnataka says the public need not panic if the card is not despatched.What's e-Aadhaar?e-Aadhaar is the digital copy of the Aadhaar card available online for genuine applicants, whose enrolment has no glitches.  .......  Over 10 lakh to 1 crore cards have been held back," said Ashok Dalwai.PAY FOR CHANGE OF ADDRESS?As of now, self-updation, like change of address, is free of cost, but there are chances of a nominal fee being charged for the service. "The fee structure depends on the registrars who've tied up with the UID. A nominal fee would be collected for such service soon," he said.

4)  Address security concerns before extending UID mandate: BJP. 
 At a time when Home Ministry and Planning Commission are at loggerheads over carrying out bio-metric collections for the Unique Identification Number project,BJP today demanded the mandate of the UIDAIs ambitious scheme should not be extended without addressing national security concerns.However,the party said by raising security concerns over the UID project,it was not siding with P Chidambaram in the ongoing battle between the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission.Security concerns are more important than the Home Ministerwe want to know by what time the National Population Register will be ready, party chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters here.He said the insistence by the Planning Commission to enroll identities beyond its initial mandate of 20 crore to ensure benefit of welfare programmes to the right beneficiary raises disturbing questions.Can the issue of development be divorced from securities issues? Welfare programmes are financed from tax payers money. Why should it go to those who have got no legal status to stay in India? There are already reports that in many parts of the country including North-East,illegal immigrants have manipulated documents to corner benefits meant for the poor as also voting rights, he said.Prasad said in this light the turf war between the Planning Commission and the Home Ministry on such a sensitive issue was very unfortunate.He said even the Parliamentary Standing committee on Finance had recently criticised the UID Bill that in substance gives statutory status to the UIDAI which means overlapping with the National Population Register (NPR),which is also engaged in collection of biometric data.Prasad used the tussle between the MHA and the plan panel to attack the UPA government,saying,confusion,chaos,differences and turf war have become the defining and disturbing feature of nearly all decisions of the UPA.Ministers dont agree,ministries differ and there is also serious disconnect between the Congress and the allies on many policy initiatives. This is the latest in the saga ofuncertainty, he said.Citing the Citizenship Act,1995,he said elaborate provisions prescribe as to who is a citizen of India,what is the qualification for the same and who can get registered as a citizen.Under section 14 A of the Act,the Central government has to compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him.  .......  Under this provision the Central Government is required to maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and issue National Identity Card to him. This is a legal obligation, he said.The Rajya Sabha MP said the whole concept of National Register of Indian Citizen and establishment of a National Registration Authority for this purpose is of fundamental importance.Citizens have rights and also obligations. The most important aspect is the issue of national security when we see massive infiltration from across the border to foment trouble,terror and destabilisation in the country, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now

UIDAI wants mobile and device manufacturers to use the Aadhaar-enabled biometric authentication.  .......  Gradually, Android devices and Apple phones are coming up with fingerprint and iris scanner in their phones itself, he said.At present, the government requests that all mobiles sold in India should be Aadhaar compliant so that they can be used effectively. It is a very good and valid idea, and the government should take it forward. As mobile devices are already loaded with data, there is no need for additional instrument and other manufacturers having access to this data, he said.DH News Service

 A day after four militants were killed in Kashmir, Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said despite the Narendra Modi governments claims, note ban has failed to check flow of terrorists and fake currency from Pakistan.In a statement issued here, Amarinder said Sundays encounter in Kashmir and reports of Pakistan pushing fake Rs 2,000 currency into India via Bangladesh were proof that the ill-conceived note ban decision was not helping curb terror as claimed by Modi. Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said.Apart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency.  .......

4)  Income tax rate is expected to come down, says Meghwal.

Both of them will be looked into," he said while addressing an event organised by Laghu Udyog Bharti here.Assuring relief to the MSME sector, Meghwal said the next budget will look into their concerns.Spelling out advantages of demonetisation, Meghwal said that it will help lower interest rate.Besides, it is choking the funding to terrorist organisation and flushing out black money from the system.Naxal activities have come down significantly across the country, he added.On the issue of major amount of old Rs 500/1000 currency have come back into the system, he said, it can be said with clarity only after reconciling data.Banks are yet to segregate fake currencies from the deposits that they have got and there are issues of double counting of deposits of banks and post offices.These issues would be cleared after reconciliation takes place, he added.With regard to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Meghwal said the government intends to implement it from April 1."The Constitution does not permit delay in GST implementation.  .......

The government notified GST on September 16 and the constitutional amendment itself says the current indirect tax system can continue for one year, after which the GST has to come," he said.If it is not implemented by September 16 next year, both states and centre would lose their power to levy tax, he said."GST will be the first act in which it will be one country, one tax which will include Jammu and Kashmir also. J&K will also have to implement GST," he said.

1)  Direct cash transfer to curb wastages, leakages: PM. 
 NEW DELHI: Centre's ambitious direct cash transfer scheme will help in better targeting of subsidies and reducing delay in delivery of benefits besides curbing wastages and leakages, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday.Addressing the 8th Civil Services Day, Singh said his government has made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in public works.He also said the government needs to make full use of new and modern technology not only in delivery of public services but in governance in general."A good example of such use is the Aadhar programme for providing all the residents of our country a unique identity, and also the Direct Benefits Transfer scheme based on Aadhar numbers that our government launched a few months back...."It will lead to better targeting of subsidies and reducing delays in the delivery of benefits such as scholarships and pensions to the intended beneficiaries. It will also help in curbing wastages and leakages, and result in greater financial inclusion," Singh said.The Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme now covers 121 districts of the country."I think it is also important to recognise the fact that the programmes like the Direct Benefits Scheme also give a sense of empowerment to the people, increase their faith in the processes of governance and therefore have a far larger positive effect than can be measured by the direct advantages they give," he said asking the bureaucrats, involved directly or indirectly in its implementation, to ensure the scheme is a success.  .......  "Our government has also made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in the work of public authorities. There are several legislative initiatives that we have taken in this regard, for example the Right to Information Act, the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill and the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. "These are intended to also help in improving the standards of delivery of public services in our country," the PM said.

4)  Kashmir encounter shows demonetisation failed: Capt Amarinder. 
 A day after four militants were killed in Kashmir, Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said despite the Narendra Modi governments claims, note ban has failed to check flow of terrorists and fake currency from Pakistan.In a statement issued here, Amarinder said Sundays encounter in Kashmir and reports of Pakistan pushing fake Rs 2,000 currency into India via Bangladesh were proof that the ill-conceived note ban decision was not helping curb terror as claimed by Modi. Stronger and sterner measures were needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people were to be guarded against frequent external assaults, he said.Apart from continuing incursions from across the border, there was sufficient ground to believe that black money remained a serious concern despite a 86% old currency getting frozen overnight following the demonetisation, said Amarinder, citing reports of frequent seizures of large sums of unaccounted for, new currency.  .......
