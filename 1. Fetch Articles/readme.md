To get media articles for a particular event like GST, Aadhar, Demonetisation etc. from the entire article article collection scraped lived on the 'gem' server:

1. Run `find-articles.py` to pick a broad set based on regex matching.

2. Refine the collection further using Stanford CoreNLP from `refine-articles`.
